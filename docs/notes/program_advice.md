	Our ideology can be described by the following guidelines:

	- Do not add new functionality unless an implementor cannot complete a real application without it.
	- It is as important to decide what a system is not as to decide what it is. Do not serve all the world's needs; rather, make the system extensible so that additional needs can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion.
	- The only thing worse than generalizing from one example is generalizing from no examples at all.
	- If a problem is not completely understood, it is probably best to provide no solution at all.
	- If you can get 90 percent of the desired effect for 10 percent of the work, use the simpler solution.
	- Isolate complexity as much as possible.
	- Provide mechanism, rather than policy. In particular, place user interface policy in the client's hands.

	From Scheifler & Gettys: "X Window System"

## Prof. John Ousterhout's Favorite Sayings

!!! quote
	[Source](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/sayings.php)
	- The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not-working to working
	- Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them
	- The most important component of evolution is death
	- Facts precede concepts
	- If you don't know what the problem was, you haven't fixed it
	- If it hasn't been used, it doesn't work
	- The only thing worse than a problem that happens all the time is a problem that doesn't happen all the time
	- The three most powerful words for building credibility are "I don't know"
	- Coherent systems are inherently unstable
