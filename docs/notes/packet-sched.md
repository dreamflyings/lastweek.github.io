I came across this topic for a research project I'm doing.

Switch buffering

- Input Queued
    - Virtual Output Queued
- Output Queued
- Combined Input and Output Queued
- Shared Memory

Packet Scheduling

- Programmable packet scheduling - PIFO
- Work-Conserving v.s. Non-Work-Conserving

I think this is a very interesting topic. Yet there are
only few papers on this topic. But there is definitely an
increasing interest.

The PIFO SIGCOMM'16 paper is for sure one of the seminal work in this space. There are some very old papers (circa 1999) on switch buffering architecute. The PIFO was proposed by a 1999 INFOCOM paper.

I may able to write more later.
