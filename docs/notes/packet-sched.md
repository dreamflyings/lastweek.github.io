I came across this topic for a research project I'm doing.

I think the switch buffering architecture and packet scheduling
are closely related. The buffering architecture could limit
what scheduling algorithms can be used.
However, I think they are still two different things
and we should look at them separately.
For example, consider a Combined Input Output Queued Switch,
I think it is possible to use a shared memory to implement
the output queues and use a separate PIFO blocks for packet scheduling.

My current impression for state-of-the-art switches is:
1) They use a large central packet buffer, can be as large as 64MB (i.e., Tofino2);
2) They could have some input and output buffers independent from the central packet buffer,
but these buffers would be small;
3) They have something called Traffic Manager to schedule packets;
4) They usually have fixed packet scheduler. I'm not quite sure whether
they have the programmable packet scheduler concept pioneered by PIFO.


## Switch buffering

- Input Queued
    - Virtual Output Queued
- Output Queued
- Combined Input and Output Queued
- Shared Memory

## Packet Scheduling

- Programmable packet scheduling - PIFO
- Work-Conserving v.s. Non-Work-Conserving

I think this is a very interesting topic. Yet there are
only few papers on this topic. But there is definitely an
increasing interest.

The PIFO SIGCOMM'16 paper is for sure one of the seminal work in this space. There are some very old papers (circa 1999) on switch buffering architecute. The PIFO was proposed by a 1999 INFOCOM paper.

I may able to write more later.

## Case Study

Let us look at some implementations out there.

### Linux Kernel

Kernel has a subsystem called queuing discipline, or `qdisc`.
It is a framework to schedule network packets.
It is built in the classical way: a generic layer and a set of ops for callback,
just like how VFS is built.
You can find a lot resources about it online.

Anyhow, you can find the code in `net/sched/sch_*.c`.
You can probably look into `sch_api.c`, `sch_generic.c`, these seem to be general
(e.g., `register_qdisc()`).
The default qdisc is called `pfifo_xxx`, you can do a `git grep` to find it.
It has quite a lot other algorithms like RED in `sch_red.c`.

So all those are software-based packet scheduling implementations.
If you are interested, you can also check out an NSDI'20 paper called `Eiffel`
from Google, which also advocates for software-based packet scheduling.
