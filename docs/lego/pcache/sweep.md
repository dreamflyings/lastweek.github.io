# Pcache Sweep

Some notes while coding pcache sweep thread. The sweep thread wants to detect the hotness of pages, and then adjust LRU list accordingly.

## Data Worth a Billion

Pcache-reclaim, or any other object reclaim, need some __data__ to algorithm about. So specific algorithm can select the `best` candidate to reclaim. In reality, algorithms are designed quite well, but __how to get the data__ part becomes extremely hard. I think this applies to many different systems.

For example, to select the hot pages in x86 is notorious hard because x86 hardware only provides a `Referenced` bit for system software to reason about. To make it worse, `Referenced` bit is cached in TLB, which means CPU will _NOT_  set the `Referenced` bit even you reset in PTE, because CPU think the bit is already set. In order to get an _accurate_ hot pages tracking, you probably need a TLB flush after reset `Referenced` bit.Â But, are you kidding me, a TLB flush after each reset? We have to say NO here. The Linux code explains it well:
```c
static inline int ptep_clear_flush_young(pte_t *ptep)
{
        /*
         * On x86 CPUs, clearing the accessed bit without a TLB flush
         * doesn't cause data corruption. [ It could cause incorrect
         * page aging and the (mistaken) reclaim of hot pages, but the
         * chance of that should be relatively low. ]
         *
         * So as a performance optimization don't flush the TLB when
         * clearing the accessed bit, it will eventually be flushed by
         * a context switch or a VM operation anyway. [ In the rare
         * event of it not getting flushed for a long time the delay
         * shouldn't really matter because there's no real memory
         * pressure for swapout to react to. ]
         */
        return ptep_test_and_clear_young(ptep);
}
```

## Aggressiveness

An aggresive sweep algorithm will disturb the normal operations a lot. In Lego, there three main factors that define the aggressiveness:

1. Number of pcache set to look at during each run
2. Number of pcache lines to look at for each set
3. Number of pcache lines to adjust for each set
