Damn it!!! After so much effort verifying we had a solid IB stack, we still has memory corruption and deadlock issues. Fuck!

One thing at a time, simple stuff first. Okay, tomorrow first add DEBUG_SPINLOCK to detect possible deadlocks. This, could help to identify some buggy code. After this, I will spend some time looking into the LITE, it's fucking HEAVY. I do found a lot issues during summer.

Personally, I'm not feeling good this days. I treat someone with love and respect, but there is not too much in return. Yeahyeahyeah, I know how this works. It's just sad that sometimes you just have a BAD timing. I've went through too much things in 2018, good and bad. I care sooo much about the people I love, family and others. I feel this is good, of course. Anyway, it is supposed to be a Lego dump, that no one probably interested in.
