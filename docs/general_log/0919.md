Well.. I should continue on this.

We moved to UCSD recently. Everything is setup except desktop and server stuff.

Started using F1 recently. Porting our code from VCU108 to VCU118. The migration
between boards and between different vivado versions is a REAL headache.
(VCU108 -> VCU118 && 2018.2 -> 2018.3)

So for those TCL scripts generated by vivado, i found it will use hardcoded IP version.
Upgrading vivado means possibly updagred IP versions, thus broken TCL scripts.
I've found a way to workaround. But if the IP interface changed, it has to be modified manually.

Many things left on the table
- Merge LegoOS code
- Think about and finish design doc
- Tons of papers to read

Life wise: sea is nearby, although UCSD gym sucks, it has jiu jitsu courses.
