Back to sweet WL. Helping out for asplos submission.
I was trying to run Octopus. Its cmake report that `MPI_C` is missing,
so I run `yum install openmpi-devel`. However, this failed due to
some broken dependency on `rdma-core` and others. It seems these packages
have been updated by mlx-ofed.. what a mess.
