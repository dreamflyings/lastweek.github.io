HA. I leaned about `perf lock`, which requies a kernel with `CONFIG_LOCKDEP` and `CONFIG_LOCK_STAT`.
Not sure exactly how these options work, but they should insert some code inside each lock acquire and release.
Anyway, with `perf lock`, we are able to know what _specific locks_ are hot. This is fantastic.

Note that normal `perf record -e 'cycles:k'` can tell use how much time is spent on `spin_lock`,
but it does not say how much time each specific lock uses. Cool.

Ah, side note, `make nconfig` is really powerful!! Even though I've been playing with Linux
for many years, I haven't actually played with linux config manually.

Tried once. Our spinlock for pgadvance list shouldn't be the issue.
Now disable it and reboot.

Bagel Day.

First replot the figrue, adding an avg/95P/99P figure.
Very long tails. Yeah!

Then tune page advance. The key is to find a not busy CPU.
I'm first trying *Round-Robin*.

Try TF Cifar. First run without pgadvance, see how
the first 100 step performs in different runs.
They seem to be very stable.
```bash
1)
	step = 100 (167.432 sec)
2)
	step = 100 (168.021 sec)
	step = 200 (167.467 sec)
3)
	step = 100 (167.903 sec)
```

DAMN. Forgot to turn off huge page.
Now use `perf` to make sure `do_anonymous_page` got enough cycles..

22/23 down, no pgadvance, 163, 161, 161
22/23 down, no pgadvance, no perf, 159

End of day. Learned how to plot Violin.
Very long tail, and does not scale well even with PCP opt!

I'm using my own benchmark to measure buddy allocator.
I'm testing order-0 alloc performance.
Something weird happen during test. The 16th line is very costly.
And after that, suddenly the perf improves nealy 50%.
I'm reporting CPU cycles, CPU frequency change shouldn't matter, right?


Linux has Per-CPU Pages (pcp), which is intended to
optimize 0-order allocation. In my test case,
each CPU keep 7 free pages. The patten is reflected
in the measurement. Note that, the refill is sync.
