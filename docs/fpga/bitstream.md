This note will explain what's inside a bitstream, how can you cook it, and how it is being configured.

I want to write this down because there is no good user-friendly introduction out there.
I felt dizzy while reading that. I bet you will too.
But the bitstream and the FPGA configurating process is not that complex
and somewhat easy to understand.

Coming.. sometime. Stay tuned.
