My name is __Yizhou Shan__ :zzz:. I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at __Purdue ECE__,
advised by Prof. [Yiying Zhang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~yiying/). Our lab is [Wuklab.io](http://wuklab.io). Yes, the [Monkey King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong) Lab.
Please find my CV [here](https://lastweek.github.io/pubs/cv.pdf).

## What's up
- [Jul 2018] Our paper __Lego: Disaggregated Operating System__ was accepted to __OSDI'18__
- [May 2018] Intern at [VMware Research](https://research.vmware.com/), with [Stanko Novakovic](https://sites.google.com/site/stankonovakovic/).

## Research

My research interests span Operating System, Distributed Systems,
and Non-Volatile Memory. I like hacking kernel and no doubt Linux is my
favorite open-source project.
