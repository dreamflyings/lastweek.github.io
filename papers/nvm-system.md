## NOVA: A Log-structured File System for Hybrid Volatile/Non-volatile Main Memories, FAST'16

- Yet another filesystem. Just a student and the professor, he must have done a
lot of work, hats off to him.
- What is new here? As its name, a LSF fs and use a lot of optimizations to
improve performance. The paper also talk about how to ensure ordering (DUH),
and they use the clwb and pcommit way (old-fashioned, huh?). And the paper
has a VERY GOOD summary about previous NVM filesystems, e.g. BPFS, PMFS.
- Quotes from the paper which I think are good:
- Providing strong consistency guarantees is particularly challenging for
memory-based file systems because maintaining data consistency in NVMM can be
costly. Modern CPU and memory systems may reorder stores to memory to improve
performance, breaking consistency in case of system failure. To compensate, the
file system needs to explicitly flush data from the CPUâ€™s caches to enforce
orderings, adding significant overhead and squandering the improved performance
that NVMM can provide
- Disks provide atomic sector writes and processors guarantee only that 8-byte
(or smaller), aligned stores are atomic. To build the more complex atomic
updates that file systems require, programmers must use more complex techniques
such as: Journaling (WAL), Shadow paging, Log-structuring.
